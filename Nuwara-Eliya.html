        <h2>Nuwara Eliya</h2>
        <p>
          Often referred to as ‘Little England’, this genteel highland community
          does have a rose-tinted, vaguely British-country-village feel to it,
          with its colonial-era bungalows, Tudor-style hotels, well-tended
          hedgerows and pretty gardens. Indeed, Nuwara Eliya was once was the
          favoured cool-climate escape for the hard-working and hard-drinking
          English and Scottish pioneers of Sri Lanka’s tea industry. A recent
          construction boom has blighted the scene to a degree, and the dusty
          and bustling centre is a thoroughly Sri Lankan urban tangle, but
          Nuwara Eliya still makes a fine base for a few days' relaxation. The
          verdant surrounding countryside of tea plantations, carefully tended
          vegetable plots and craggy hills is highly scenic. Treat yourself to a
          night in one of Nuwara Eliya’s colonial hotels, play a round of golf
          or a few frames of billiards, and soak up the town’s unique bygone
          heritage.

            One of the most endowments of Nuwara Eliya, is the Gregory lake
            which is located within 1 km from Nuwara Eliya town, Sri Lanka. It
            was built by the British governor, Gregory in 1874. It is a great
            destination to relax and spend time with your colleagues, friends or
            relatives. Hence the area is ideal for recreational activities and
            several water sports. It is believed that the major aim of the lake
            is to generate and provide electricity for Nuwara Eliya, during the
            colonial period. The Gregory Lake expands for 91.2 hectares and
            nourished with water from Nanuoya, floating through the city.

            holidays. You will have to buy a ticket to enter the park and if you
            want a bicycle ride, can hire one. Unfortunately, if you are a
            foreigner, you may feel that the entry fee is more than expected.
            The boat rides, swan boat rides, and horse ridings are common. But
            the balloon ride in the lake is proved to be astounded. In order to
            play with it, you will have to go inside the big plastic balloon.
            Then the supporters will push the balloon to the lake and it will
            float. Never the less it will be a distinct experience that you ever
            had. During last two years, the entire lake and the area were fully
            revamped and modified. Therefore now it looks more beautiful. You

          <h4>Pidurutalagala Mountain</h4>
          <p>
            Yet another place to be visited in Nuwara Eliya district of Sri
            Lanka is the tallest mountain of Sri Lanka, so called as the
            Piduruthalagala mountain range. This mountain bio diversity is more
            suitable for hiking, climbing or mountaineering. Travelers are
            preferred to climb this mountain during the months of April-June.
            Probably it is a bit harder goal to reach the top of the peak which
            is about 2524m above MSL. The Piduruthalagala Mountain or the Mount
            Pedro is located North- Northeast from the Nuwara Eliya city. The
            most interesting feature is that the mountain is the ultra
            high-security zone where few buildings are established by the Sri
            Lankan military forces. So that you may need to arrange permission
            from the ministry of defense in order to reach the top. Another
            broadcasting corporation building is set on the top of the mountain.
            You will have to travel on a concrete road and some more kilo meters
            through the thick jungle. Somehow these kinds of constructions may
            lead the mountain to be modernized. If so it will be a great threat
            to the Mount Pedro. Magnificent vicinity to the mist covered
            mountain tops and mountain ranges can be enjoyed leisurely.

          <h4>Devon Falls</h4>
          <p>
            Devon water fall is one of the most beautiful cascades of Sri Lanka,
            located at close to Talawakele town. Further, it is one of the six
            falls impacted with upper Kotmale hydro power project. But it has
            been unable to reduce the water capacity of the fall. This fall gets
            the name because of the pioneer British coffee planter, Mr. Devon
            whose cultivations and plantations are nearby the fall. This 97 m
            high cascade is above 1159 m from sea level. No any trip to Sri
            Lanka will be successful and completed except a journey to the hill
            country of Nuwara Eliya. Nuwara Eliya is considered as a major
            tourist attraction yet it has a cluster of sites to be explored.
            Among them, waterfalls are significant. Slothful tourists can
            entertain a view while staying on the main road of Talawakele to
            Hatton. But a closer view will be quite worth. You have to stop at
            the 20th-mile post and walk about 1 km through the lush greenly tea
            plantations to reach the waterfall. Close to Devon falls, you will
            find St. Clair waterfall. The salubrious climate has been an extra
            feature of the area to be experienced.
