          <h4>Buddhangala Monastery</h4>
          <p>
            The Buddhangala Monastery lies deep within the jungles concerning 7
            kilometers off Ampara. The Monastery addresses 1280 acres masking 5
            rocks the place the stays of the historical monastery can be
            noticed. This community belonged in direction of the Digamadulla
            Kingdom which was commenced by means of Prince Dighayu within just
            the 4th century BC. All whilst the commencing of this monastery is
            not claimed, Ven Ellawala Medhananda Thero suggests that the
            background of his monastery is as outdated as the Digamadulla
            Kingdom. Dropped within just the historical past, included via thick
            jungle infested with wild pets, unveiled toward the supplies for
            more than countless numbers of decades, this monastery was
            introduced back again in the direction of everyday living in just
            1964 through a younger courageous bikku referred to as Kalutara
            Dhammananda, (incumbent substantial priest presently) who traveled
            during the thick jungles and cleared the Space with the advice of
            Buddhists inside of the House. This hermitage arrived towards
            prominence owing to the relics unearthed for the duration of
            excavation of the authentic stupa. In between, them was a 4-inch
            gold casket with 3 golden lotus bouquets reputation upon its stems
            with very carefully positioned relics upon every single of them. The
            heart flower was tallest and 2 bo leaves upon the other 2 stems
            experienced the names Sariputha and Maha Moggalana inscribed upon
            them.

          <h4>Samangala</h4>
          <p>
            Samangala site located in Ampara became very famous because of the
            Samangala Cave and the forest hermitage. Samangala cave is situated
            to the west of the Kohombana junction of Gonagala-Ampara road. To
            the eastern slope of the hill, many drip ledged caves can be seen.
            For history enthusiasts, this will be a well worth a visit to
            Samangala site. They are used asKuti (shanties) of the monks. You
            have to climb up on a steep stair to reach the Bo maluwa and the
            main cave. It is believed that since from the past Buddhist monks
            came to these caves to involve in medications. A head monk is
            guiding and motivating other monks to develop meditation skills on
            behalf of freeing from lust and greediness. Nowadays a group of
            bhikkus is meditating in the caves. Some are set amidst the caves
            for penance. Perhaps you may get astounded by looking at the entire
            area. Below the Bo maluwa you can see a stream. Few Christian
            Brahmin inscriptions can be seen in the Samangala cave. An
            inscription of a Dagoba is illustrated in a high boulder of one
            cave. Archaeologists say that the sketch promenaded in the cave is
            similar to theSanchi Stupa in India. Such witnesses prove that Sri
            Lankans had connections with other Bhikkus from various countries.

          <h4>Kudumbigala</h4>
          <p>
            Kudumbigala is an abandoned sanctuary and a monastery complex
            located on a range of rocks in Ampara Sri lanka.Other than that it
            is a sacred groove. Close to it is Kumbukkan oya and Yala National
            park. Kudumbigala is also known as Chethiya Pabbatha. The hermitage
            was found and established in 1954 by a devotee named Mathree. Since
            it was rediscovered it was hidden in the thick jungle. Upasaka
            maithree was a catholic. But he came to Kudumbigala and cleaned and
            safeguarded it. Therefore we must be grateful to him for protecting
            this historic place. Though it is a historically valuable
            destination built by King Decanam piya tissa in 2nd century B.C. It
            is recognized as the first refuge made for Bhikku. He is the
            initiator to establish Buddhsm in Sri Lanka. Kudumbigala monastery
            complex is located on a land of 600 acre. Kudumbigala can be reached
            easily from Panama (11 miles from panama and 17 from Kumana
            village). There are over 200 cave reservations. The caves were
            carved with drip ledgers (Kattarama) in order to protect the caves
            from rain. The inner walls of the cave are plastered and painted
            with enthusiastic paintings and frescoes. Rather than other
            archeological sites Kudumbigala is a untouched complex of cave sand
            buildings. Apart from that today few monks at the Kudumbigala
            viharaya are imitating the meditations.

            with Lord Buddhas presence. Henceforward it is another famous
            destination in most attractive tourism destinations in Sri lanka.
            Later the Dagoba appeared like a thick jungle. Due to the
            reconstructions carried out by the authorities, Henceforth it has

            while at Digawapiya and spent time for meditating. It is said that
            Buddha visited Sri lanka with 5000 arahants. Mahavansaha
            (substantial documentary about history o Sri lanka, written in 5th
            century) reveals that, king Sadhdhatissa (137-119B.C) initiated to

          <h4>Magul Maha Viharaya</h4>
          <p>
            Magul maha viharaya is just one of the clusters of sites which
            travelers esteem about. In other names it is Ruhunu Maha Viharaya.
            The Magul maha vihara monastery complex is located to the southern
            part of Sithulpawwa. So that you can take the siyabalanduwa-pottuvil
            road and travel for about 22 km off from Siyambalandwa. Otherwise
            you can take 11 km off from Pottuvil. The viharaya is deemed as the
            place where King Kavantissa (2nd century) used to marry Princess
            Vihara Maha Devi. People believe that the ruined Magul maduwa was
            the place where the wedding ceremony took place. Never the less it
            is said that the wedding ceremony of King kavantissa was celebrated
            in a place nearby Muhudu Maha Viharaya at Arugam Bay. Another
            version is that it was built by King Datusena (516 126A.D). Later it
            was revamped by Queen Viharamahadevi. Queen viharamahadevi is the
            wife of KingBuvaneka bahu 5 og Gampola Kingdom. In so far as it is
            difficult to elect which version of the history is correct. There is
            a stone scripture which dates back to 14th century. Yet magul maha
            is situated in a part of the Yala national park, covers an area
            about 10000 acres. On the way to the temple you will meet a Lake
            with Lotus flowers. Ruins of a ancient Dagoba are still surviving.
            The vihara consist of a unique Moonstone (sanda kada pahana) which
            is a remarkable masterpiece of Sinhalese. Usually there were no
            mahouts in the moonstones designed within all kingdoms. But here the
            elephants with mahouts are carved in this half circle shaped
            moonstone. The dwarfs in Rock crafts have hindered the entrance of
            evil eye.
