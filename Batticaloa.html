        <h2>Batticaloa</h2>
        <p>
          Historic Batticaloa, Batti for short, enjoys a spectacular position
          surrounded by lagoons with palm-filtered sunlight glancing off the
          water. There's a mellow vibe to the town, and the compact centre and
          its huge fortress and many churches are well worth a half-day's
          exploration on foot.

          <h4>Dutch Fort</h4>
          <p>
            Places like Dutch fort Batticaloa attract both local and foreign
            travelers from all around the world. It is the main city of Eastern
            province of Sri Lanka. This Dutch fort of Batticaloa was built on
            1628 as a trading and economical administration center of Ceylon in
            the Colonial era. It was used to trade cinnamon, pepper, chilly and
            miscellaneous things to other countries. Batticaloa is called as the
            â€˜land of the singing fishâ€™. Not only that but also it is a
            testimony of Sri Lankan history. At that time Portuguese governors
            were in charge of Ceylon. The Fort bulges into a lacustrine plain.
            With the arrival of Dutch to Ceylon in 1602, Kandyan King Rajasingha
            pleased to Dutch to eradicate Portuguese from the island. As a
            result of that Dutch captured the fort Batticaloa in 1638 and
            evidenced their primacy to the world. The Fort had been under
            control of the Dutch nearly for 20 years. But Sri Lanka was again
            invaded by the Britains. So that the Dutch had to surrender Britains
            and the fort had to hand over to the Britain in 1772. Therefore the
            fort is a memorial of all those 3 colonies. The fort is bordered by
            a gutter. Fort Batticaloa is now an archeological site, being
            preserved for our future generation. High stone walls, especially
            the remaining Buddhist stupa and shatra which belongs to Ruhunu
            Kindom are facts that support to the religious inference in the 1st
            century. The stupa was placed by the King Kavantissa. Today
            structures of 4 bastions are preserved from the entire natural
            disasters. There are several other buildings around the fort built
            at different periods.
