        <h2>Colombo</h2>
        <p>
          Although it's unlikely it will reclaim its 19th-century moniker 'the
          garden city of the East', Colombo has nevertheless emerged as a
          must-see stop in Sri Lanka. No longer just the sprawling city you have
          to endure on your way to the beaches, it has become a worthy
          destination in its own right and makes an excellent start – or finish
          – to your Sri Lankan adventures.

          <h4>Dehiwala Zoo</h4>
          <p>
            Dehiwala Zoo, in other names Colombo zoo is a paradise of animals.
            Places like Dehiwala zoo attract thousands of travelers to the zoo.
            Most of the time the zoo gets crowded with many local and foreign
            travelers. Yet it is a home to the animals and birds it provides
            animal conservation, education, and welfare services. The National
            Zoological Gardens of Sri Lanka is another name for the zoo.
            Dehiwala zoo was founded by John Harnesberg. Even though he could
            export animals to the animal dealers in Europe. But the government
            took it into their control in 1936. The zoo has an entitled special
            vision, "To create one of the worlds outstanding zoological
            institutions, that is a centre of the excellence for conservation,
            research and education" and mission is "Resourceful conservation of
            animals by means of a learning, achieved through the exhibition of
            species which were adopted with loving care". Dehiwala Zoo is
            expecting to expand the animal population with the animal exchange
            programs with other countries. The authorities are active to
            conserve endangered species and look after them. The zoo has an
            annual income around Rs.40 million. You can attend to the elephant
            show performed daily. Another show is the Sea lion show. Probably it
            is a quite funny show. Visitors can refer to the time tables and
            entertain themselves by participating them. The butterfly garden
            located in the middle of the Dehiwala zoo is small but consists a
            vast collection of butterflies (around 30 species). The garden is
            beautified with trees, bushes and streams. The inner temperature is
            controlled by an artificial mist. Every day the zoo is open from
            8.30 a.m to 6.00 p.m. Elephants show starts at 4.30 p.m everyday.

          <h4>Galle Face Green</h4>
          <p>
            Passing by the Old parliament, since now it is used as the
            presidential secretariat; Gall face green is a long park beside with
            the beach. It is in the South of the fort. Because of this, it is a
            venue for social, religious, cultural and entertaining occasions.
            The place is decent for families to gather and enjoy their lives
            leisurely. Sir Henry Ward was the initiator of this entire site who
            was the governor of Ceylon in 1859. He accessed this place as a golf
            course and for horse races. This narrowed park is separated from
            Beira Lake from Slave Island. Slave Island is the place where the
            Dutch held a prison of African slaves brought by Portuguese in 1630.
            There is no chance to walk with hungry, as numerous food stalls are
            selling various foods and refreshments. Looming over the site, you
            will see the lined cannons facing to the sea, lined palm trees next
            to the coast are beautifying the surrounding. It seems like those
            cannons are still ready to fire. Further, it stretches for a half
            kilometer along the coast. Simultaneously the Galle face green
            covers an area about 5 hectares. On weekends it becomes full of
            children, joggers, kite flyers, and lovers. Usually, the place is a
            favorite destination of teenagers and tourists. It is used to host
            and celebrate the national independence day of Sri Lanka (held on
            4th of February every year) several times.

          <h4>Gangaramaya Temple</h4>
          <p>
            Yet another sacred place to be visited in Colombo is the Gangaramaya
            Temple. It has been recognized as an influential traveling
            destination among the both local and foreign tourists and pilgrims.
            The Gangarama Buddhist temple is located nearby the Brira Lake. It
            is built around the 1800s. In contrast, the temple is 120 years old,
            but compared to the other temples of Sri Lankan history it is new.
            Not only in the Poya days most of the time the temple is congregated
            with worshippers and tourists. The temple was positioned by
            Venerable Hikkaduwe Sumangala nayaka thero. Yet he is the founder
            Vidyodaya Pirivena in Sri Lanka provides educational and orientation
            facilities for Bhikkus. But now it is transformed and known as the
            University of Sri jayawardenapura. Devundara Sri Jinarathana Nayaka
            thero was the administrator of the Gangarama temple. Further
            Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala nayaka thero formed a foundation to maintain
            the temple. It is a proud to say that a hair relic of Lord Buddha
            was gifted from Bangladesh. This holy relic was placed at the
            Gangaramaya temple. The long perimeter wall is decorated with
            dwarfs, Buddhists believe that such pigmy statues avoid the bad luck
            and bring you the prosperity. The temple is constituted of a library
            and a museum rather than other temples.

          <h4>Independence Square</h4>
          <p>
            Independence square is one of Colombos many landmarks to be
            discovered. Independence Memorial Hall located at the Independence
            square is a Sri Lankan Heritage site among the Sri Lankan Tourism.
            Many travelers visit the place and walk in the interior of the Hall.
            This hall was built to commemorate and the victory gained from the
            British rule in 1948. Sri Lanka has only few monuments in memory of
            the heroes of the Independence. The construction process was started
            after the independence. The construction was empowered by D.S
            Senanayake but it was handed over to Sir. John Kotalawela. In
            addition, they had a vision entitled â€˜ Worthy of Sri lankas long
            and impressive history. Mr. Wynne Jonnes, Mr. Shirely DAlwis, and
            Mr. Olivier weerasingha initiated to design the construction. In
            front of the Hall is a statue of late D.S Senanayake, who was
            appointed as the first prime minister of Sri Lanka. Even today so
            many reputed people, national leaders and people come to celebrate
            the independence we gained. While examining the architecture used at
            the hall you will feel that it is similar to the kandyan magul
            maduwa in Kandy. In fact, kandyan audience hall in kandy (Magul
            Viharaya) is a rich architectural monument. The columns, ceilings,
            and pillars are decorated, carved with Traditional Sri Lankan Arts.

          <h4>Kalaniya Raja Maha Viharaya</h4>
          <p>
            Kelaniya Raja Maha viharaya is a Buddhist temple basking on the __
            province of Sri Lanka. The chief monk, Kollupitiye mahinda
            Sangarakkitha thero is in charge of the Viharaya. Lord Buddha had
            arrived in Sri Lanka three times after his Enlightenment. Kelaniya
            is one of those 3 destinations. Harking back to the Buddhas time,
            Lord Gautama Buddha was invited by Naga king â€˜Maniakkika. At that
            time there were 3 major tribes in Sri Lanka called Deva, Naga and
            Yaksha. The Kelaniya temple was also constructed by him containing
            and securing the jeweled throne whereas Buddha used to sit while
            preaching Buddha's hair. In fact, the place became hallowed with 500
            arahant Bhikkhus. The temple became one of the most venerated places
            after the Arahat Mahinda thero and sangamitta thero brought Buddhism
            to Sri Lanka The reclining statue of Lord Buddha and frescoes
            painted on the walls of the temple are attractive. The paintings
            regarding the arrival of their Sangamitta and Thero Mahindra
            bringing the sapling of Jayasri Maha bodhi is interesting. Many
            Jathaka stories, landmarks of Sri Lankan buddhism are depicted in
            the frescoes. Traditional Sinhala designs and patterns are carved in
            the pillars. The old paintings in the image house (Vihara geya)
            belong to the Kandyan era. The temple was concerned and gained its
            highest glory during the Kotte kingdom. In 1510 Portuguese destroyed
            the temple.

            Lanka in 1877. Under the guidance of the governor, the Royal Asiatic
            Society initiated to build the museum. The building is designed
            regarding the Italian architecture. Most important regalia, the
            throne of the Kandyan King) are also preserved in the museum. Today
            the authorities have planned and arranged multiplex arrangements to
            exhibit the ancient heritage of Sri Lanka. The construction process
            of the museum was carried out by Arasi Marikar Wapachi Marikar, aka
            Wapchi Marikar (Bass) who came to Ceylon in 1060 AD.The museum was
            uplifted as a national museum during the period of Dr.P.E.P
            Deraniyagala. He was capable enough to setup extension branches of
            the national museum at Kandy, Ratnapura, and Jaffna.

          <h4>Isipathanaramaya Temple</h4>
          <p>
            Isipatanaramaya is a temple, located in the heart of Sri Lankan
            Economy Colombo. It can be easily accessed from Colombo. Colombo was
            made as the capital of Sri Lanka by the British empire in 1815. It
            contains beautiful frescoes dates back to 1920. The frescoes were
            drawn by Master Sarlis. The temple was built to commemorate Mr.Henry
            Pedris. The story behind the beginning of the temple is pathetic.
            Mr. Henry Pedris was executed by the British government in 1915
            because of his support to the national outbursts. Later he was
            killed by the execution squad. Later the statement was proven false.
            Therefore his execution at a young age was agitation in the
            community. The temple is an attempt to the Buddhist philosophy with
            lots of frescoes, distinctive murals and statues casting the Lord
            Buddhas Journey of life. A dagoba is constructed and visualized in
            milky white. The colors used for the paintings are gorgeous and very
            beautiful. The authorities had not changed anything to muster the
            temple for decades but the originality of the temple has been
            conserved. You can acquire peaceful feelings by visiting the Image
            house or the Viharaya. It is a large shrine room decorated with
            vivid colored sculptures and paintings in the early 1900s. In poya
            days the temple becomes crowded with lots of pilgrims, devotees, and
            tourists.

          <h4>Seema Malakaya</h4>
          <p>
            Seemamalakaya is a witness that Buddhism is conciliatory. It is
            positioned as a floating temple on the Beira Lake. Visitors say that
            this floating pavilion has added some colors to the Gangaramaya
            temple. It is a witness to prove that Seema malakaya is a recherche
            destination and a monument in Sri lankan Tourism. Recently it must
            be visited without denying. Subsequently, it is like an artificial
            manmade island. It has consisted of 2 pavillions. From that Seema
            malakaya is a part of Gangaramaya Temple. Gangaramaya Temple can be
            toured as it is on the opposite side of the Seema malakaya. This
            eye-catching temple was designed by Geoffrey Bawa in 1985. Tourists
            say that even a walk through the temple is a meditation. Of course,
            it is a great opportunity to relax your stressed minds. You have to
            walk over a pontoon boardwalk to enter the Seema malakaya. This is
            considered as a meditating place and a gathering hall for the monks
            of Gangaramaya Temple. Therefore the surrounding doesnt consist of
            mosaic colours. It is designed in accordance with a charming tone.
            Otherwise, it could be affected to break the absorption the
            meditating practices carried out by the monks. Inside of the
            Hermitage is many Buddha statues. Eventually, there is a model of
            Lord Buddhas Foot sculptured of marbles.

          <h4>Lotus Tower</h4>
          <p>
            Lotus Tower (Sinhala: නෙළුම් කුළුණ; Tamil: தாமரைக் கோபுரம்), also
            referred to as Colombo Lotus Tower, is a tower of 356 m (1,168 ft),
            located in Colombo, Sri Lanka.It also reflects the symbolic landmark
            of Sri Lanka. As of 16 September 2019, the tower is currently the
            tallest self-supported structure in South Asia. It is also the
            second tallest structure in South Asia after the guy-wire-supported
            INS Kattabomman in India. The tower is also the 11th tallest
            completed tower in Asia and it is also the 19th tallest tower in the
            world.It was first proposed to be built in the suburb of Peliyagoda
            but later the Government of Sri Lanka decided to shift the
            location.The lotus-shaped tower will be used for communication,
            observation and other leisure facilities, with construction costing
            $104.3 million, funded by EXIM Bank of People's Republic of China.It
            is visible throughout Colombo, its suburbs and most major highways
            radiating from and around the city. The design of this building is
            inspired by the Lotus flower. The lotus symbolizes purity within Sri
            Lankan culture and is also said to symbolize the country's
            flourishing development. The tower base is inspired by the lotus
            throne and will also be formed by two inverted trapezoidal.The
            tower's color is planned to alternate between pink and light yellow
            by smooth transition- an effect achieved by coating the glass. The
            tower is approximately 350 m (1,150 ft) tall and covers 30,600 m2
            (329,000 sq ft) of floor area. Lotus Tower's main revenue sources
            will be tourism and antenna leasing. It will function as a radio and
            television broadcasting antenna ISDB-T and proposed DVB-T2 support
            structure for 50 television services, 35 FM Radio Stations and 20
            telecommunication service providers,and will house a variety of
            tourist attractions[citation needed].

          <p>
            This is envisaged as the 1st Bamboo garden and, eco center in Sri
            Lanka. Una Arana museum is a part of the eco-friendly tourism of Sri
            Lanka. It is a step to the environmental conservation. It was opened
            in 2000 with a single bamboo tree. The garden is located at
            Arukwatte, Padukka in Sri Lanka. Though it is an information center
            it can be used to spend your leisure time under the shade of these
            huge Bamboo bushes. The garden inherited from Mr. Chandanas parents
            covers an area about 100 perch. The owner of this garden is Mr.
            Chandana Maitige. He is a creative and well-experienced person in
            this Bamboo related productions. He wants to promote organic free
            productions rather than Polythene and Plastic. He says that the
            society should be motivated to reject such kinds of unsustainable
            uses. He doesnt expect an entry fee or any other fee to enter the
            museum. Household types of equipment, agricultural tools and
            miscellaneous instruments made of Bamboo are exhibited in the
            museum. Mr. Chandanas prime ambition is to build an eco-friendly
            society and save the environment. His dedication to building this
            park is admirable. The garden and the museum are open to everyone.
            Over 1250 varieties of bamboo have been identified by the
            Environmentalists from whole around the world. This Una Arana
            consists about 25 varieties of Bamboo and from those 10 varieties a
            very special. Thus 8 varieties are indigenous to Sri Lanka. It is
            hard to believe that two of them can be eaten as a food.
