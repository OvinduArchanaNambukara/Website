          <h4>Hummanaya Blow Hole</h4>
          <p>
            Hambanthota district has made tremendous strides at a pace to
            Hummanaya in other names Kudawella Blow Hole, ranked among the top
            tourism destinations in Hambanthota District Sri Lanka. it is a rare
            geological experience made at Kudawella village of Southern
            province, Sri Lanka. You may hear the sounds of the blow hole on
            your way from Dickwella to Kudawella. It is just 1.1 km from
            Dikwella to Kudawella. This curious feature of Ho-ho-hoo sound makes
            you hurry to reach the destination. Kudawella Blow hole area is
            embellished with rocky cliffs. There is a rock boulder in the middle
            of the rocky cliffs with a breakage in the middle. When the sea
            waves hit the rock, the water force passes out through the hole at
            the bottom of the rock and shoots about few meters high into the
            air. It needs two powerful sea waves from two different directions
            to be waddled each other. A windy climate will worth very much. If
            so you will be astonished by the a jet of water. It is a must to say
            that this scenery is breathtakingly mysterious in monsoon rain
            season. Perchance it will take about 10-15 minutes to get ready for
            a new shoot up. This stunning blow hole is almost visited by
            tourists.

          <h4>Madunagala Hot Springs</h4>
          <p>
            Madunagala hot springs will be a monumental experience that you may
            ever have before. It is a beautiful creation of nature situated in
            Madunagala hermitage in the Southern province of Sri Lanka. To reach
            the place you have to take Pelmadulla- Nonegama road and Pass by
            about 66-kilo meters till you find Padanangala junction. Then turn
            for Padanangala-Sooriyawewa road. Finally, you have to travel about
            12 km on the route to Sooriyawewa. Within few more steps from the
            main road, you will find the complex. The place is open from 7.00 am
            to 7.00 pm. In rainy seasons the hot springs shoot about 65cubic
            meters per second. You can see five hot springs covered with a basin
            or a stone tank. People believe that this water has an unbelievable
            power to cure skin diseases as well as eye diseases. Simultaneously
            the monks resided at nearby hermitages and cave temples are
            attempted to have baths here instead of healing skin eczemas and
            rheumatic injuries. Even today devotees believe that baths energize
            them. They strongly believe that their skin diseases or rashes can
            be vanished by bathing. Sir. Leonard Woolf, who was an assistant
            government agent has indicated that he also visited Madunagala hot
            springs. Somehow if you could visit the place in early in the
            morning you can see many varieties of birds in the sky.

            lagoons. The whole area is almost decorated by vividly colored
            species of birds that are looking for palatable harvests. Absolutely
            the lagoons areas are rich of aquatic birds and bio diversity. The
            greater flamingo is the remarkable bird of the migrants. The coastal
            area is mostly used by the sea turtles to lay their eggs during the
            night. It is recorded that 5 varieties of turtles are visiting the
            coasts. Over 200 species of birds including both migrant and
            resident birds are living together in the park. Perhaps you may see
            elephants strolling in the park.

          <h4>Sithulpawwa Temple</h4>
          <p>
            Sithulpawwa rock temple monastery is an edifice dedicated for
            religious worships in the country of Sri Lanka. In order to reach
            the temple, you have to travel about 30 from Yala village. The name
            of Siththul pawwa was derived from Cittal Pawwa. It meant The hill
            of the quiet mind. The temple beholds a great possession since 2000
            years ago. Certainly, there were about 12000 arahant monks in
            residence around the 1st century. There are 2 temples positioned on
            the high stunning rock. From that â€˜Maha Sithulpawwa â€˜rock is 400
            feet in height. The Sithulpawwa Dagoba, perched on the top of the
            rock can be toured with steep stair cut into the rock. This ancient
            type was built by King Kavantissa (100-140 A.D). Besides the dagoba
            is an intricate cave complex. This cave temple is 67 feet high and
            30 feet long. The caves are made to provide shelter and accommodate
            reservations for Bhikkhus. The wall paintings at the main cave
            belong to Anuradhapura era. Due to the excavations, few Brahmi
            inscriptions were found. The inscriptions proclaim that the
            villagers donated money to erect and maintain Sithulpawwa monastery
            around the 2nd century. It is believed that the temple is an
            enormous shrine for devotees as well as a center of Buddhist
            scholarship. Climbing towards the rock is a little bit hard but well
            worth. Due to the high elevation, a fulgent spectacle of Hambanthota
            district can be from the top of the rock.
