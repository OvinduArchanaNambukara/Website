          <h4>Galle Fort Overview</h4>
          <p>
            Galle Fort is by far the most important tourist attraction in Galle.
            Spread over a humongous area of 36 acres, the fort is a settlement
            in itself which showcases the century-old culture and colonial
            heritage of Galle. A multi-ethnic population inhabits it, and a tour
            through the fort is sure to impress you with its majestic age-old
            architecture. It has managed to survive major tests of time,
            including the devastating Tsunami of 2004. It has now been declared
            a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The site itself holds
            archaeological, historical as well as architectural significance,
            and it also has several attractions within its territory; from
            buzzing cafes, bookstores and restaurants to museums, gift and
            jewellery shops, hotels and offices built in the colonial-style
            architecture.

            Kalpitiya was originally known by the ancient Tamils as Kav Putti,
            and was a popular hub for Arab merchants. In the early 16th century
            the Portuguese invaded the area, naming the area Kardiv Island. The
            King of Portugal bestowing the territory to the Jesuits, who built a
            chapel here,[2] establishing a small garrison to defend it. In an
            effort to free the port from the Portuguese the King of Kandy, King
            Rasjasinha II, sought assistance from the Dutch, who in 1659
            conquered the area but did not return it to the King, instead they
            commenced construction of a fort in 1667, which was completed in
            1676. Kalpitiya was strategically important for the Dutch East India
            Company (VOC), as it enabled them to control the external trade of
            the Kingdom of Kandy, by controlling the large Muslim trading
            community in the area. The Dutch called the town Calpentyn or
            Calpetty, occupying the fort there until the end of the 18th
            century. They also built a small church, with a similar character to
            the church in Matara. When the British invaded Ceylon, the Dutch
            soldiers and officials were recalled to Colombo, as a result the
            British found the fort empty except for a Dutch administrative
            officer, who promptly surrendered the fort to them. In the beginning
            of the 1800s when most of the Dutch left the island services at the
            church stopped. The church was subsequently used by Anglican
            missionaries.

            The Jungle Beach is an out-of-the-way and serene beach that is a
            storehouse of all the quiet time you need on your holiday. Located a
            little ahead of the Japanese Peace Pagoda, this Beach is one of the
            most relaxed one and is much less swarming than all the other
            tourist places in Galle. You can sit back on the sandy beach and get
            a perfect tan, or swim in the clear waters that seem like a mirror
            image of the ground below. If you are a fan of the aquatic life,
            then you could spend some time Snorkeling to see for yourself the
            life of the rich marine life in Galle.

          <h4>Galle Fort Lighthouse</h4>
          <p>
            Galle Lighthouse also is known as Pointe De Galle Light is Sri
            Lanka’s oldest light station. Established in 1848 as the first
            onshore lighthouse in Galle, Sri Lanka, the original 80 feet
            structure was destroyed by a fire and the existing second structure
            was built in 1939, just 100 meters away from where its predecessor
            stood. Standing at 26.5 meters tall the first lighthouse light was
            furnished with a glass prism lens supported on friction reducing
            Mercury bath. The bath of mercury had two purposes; one was to keep
            the lamp at a perfect level and the other was to make the rotation
            of the lamp smooth and frictionless. Like many lighthouse keepers of
            the old days, around the world, the lighthouse keepers at the Galle
            Fort lighthouse must also have been exposed to high levels of highly
            toxic Mercury on a daily basis. Particularly when they had to remove
            impurities from the top of the bath and periodically cleaning the
            liquid metal by passing it through chamois leather. Fortunately, the
            lighthouse light at Galle Fort has long been automated, and the
            keeper only makes the 87 feet climb for maintenance and to keep an
            eye on the ships entering the Galle Harbour from its high point in
            Point Utrecht Bastion.
