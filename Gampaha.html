          <h4>Attanagalla Raja Maha Viharaya</h4>
          <p>
            The ancient temple Attanagalla Raja Maha Viharaya is being surrounded by devotees as well as travelers. The first feature is the monument built to commemorate King Siri Sanghabo who sacrificed his head. The exact place where the king offered his head is inside the temple. A Dagoba is constructed in the hermitage. People believe that Attanagala is the place where King Siri sanghabo lived after handing over his kingdom to his brother Gotabhya (249-262). King Siri Sanghabo depicts a dominant character in ancient Sri Lankan history. But the archeologists say that the belief is wrong and the true destination is Haththikuchchi viharaya in Anuradhapura. The vihara is inimitable as it is the only ancient temple whereas Bodhisatwa Buddha had gained his dana paramita in order to become a Buddha. At the time Bodhisatwa Buddha was the spirit of Siri sanghabo.

            The chronicle behind the temple is interesting. Once, King Sanghabodhi, Gotabhaya and Sanghatissa were hunting around Tissa wewa. A blind man lived near, murmured â€˜the earth bears these three kingsâ€™. Gotabhya heard this very clearly and he asked that whose reign will lasted long. The man answered â€˜the last oneâ€™s my lordâ€™. But Gotabhaya didnâ€™t say anything to Sanghabodi and Sanghatissa. In addition, Sanghatissa was appointed as the King of Sri Lanka. But he had to die after 4 years in fact of eating poisoned fruits. The next king was King Sanghabodhi. But King Gotabhaya resisted his pattern of ruling the city. Therefore king Gotabhaya abducted the right to the throne from Sanghabodhi. Therefore king Sanghabodhi went to a forest and lived in a hermitage.

          <h4>Alawala Pre-Historic Archeolical Site</h4>
          <p>
            Yet another pre historic place to be visited is Alawala, Gampaha. Remains of two pre historic humans and some artifacts are conserved in the caves. As a matter of fact, the Potugal lena of Allawa takes us about 125000 years back. You have to get Kirindiwela  Niitambuwa road first and about 3 km off from the main road you can find the Potugal lena. It seems to be there are 3 main caves. In detail, they are Vihara lena, Potu gal lena and the thapo lena.

Thapo lena was used as a place for meditations disclosed for bhikkhus. Rather than that the Vihara lena declares about 2 eras of ancient Sri Lankan Buddhism. A reclining Buddha statue which harks back to the kandyan era and two seated Buddha statues constructed around Anuradhapura reign can be seen. By the way, the statues have been damaged by the treasure hunters. The most important incident is the ancient illustrations of Buddha images, sketched on a polished rock surface. They cannot be considered as a matured art but they help to form a vision about the Allawwa pre historic man.
Skull residual reveals that two people are buried amidst the premise. One is an older woman and the other is a young man. Numerous sea shells, parts of skeletons, bone fossils, snail shells some molars of an adult and a youngster are unearthed. Yet the excavators are still on their duty to discover this site a large hole dug into the earth still remains. Presently the site is being excavated by the university students of Kelaniya. Around 55 students from the Masterâ€™s degree program including chemists, geologists, and archaeologists are working together to recover our ancient pre historic era.
