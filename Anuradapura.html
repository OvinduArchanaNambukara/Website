        <h2>Anuradapura</h2>
        <p>
          The ruins of Anuradhapura are one of South Asia’s most evocative
          sights. The sprawling complex contains a rich collection of
          archaeological and architectural wonders: enormous dagobas (brick
          stupas), ancient pools and crumbling temples, built during
          Anuradhapura’s thousand years of rule over Sri Lanka. Today, several
          of the sites remain in use as holy places and temples; frequent
          ceremonies give Anuradhapura a vibrancy that’s a sharp contrast to the
          museum-like ambience at Polonnaruwa.

          <h4>Ruwanwali Saaya</h4>
          <p>
            Ruwanweli maha Seya was built by the great king Dutugamunu who
            reigned from 137BC to 119BC from Anuradhapura. Next to Sri Maha
            Bodhi, Ruwanweli Seya temple is the most venerated Buddhist site in
            Anuradhapura. After the defeat of Elara, the South Indian invader
            and bringing the whole country under one rule by the great warrior
            king Dutugemunu, building of Ruwanweli Seya has been given the most
            prominence in most ancient texts in Sri Lanka. The original stupa
            has been about 180 feet (55 metres) in height and had been expanded
            and renovated by many kings thereafter. The stupa is 350 feet (107
            metres) in height and 300 feet (92 metres) in diameter today.
            <br />King Dutugamunu didn’t live to see the completion of this
            massive stupa. When the king fell ill, he sent his brother to
            complete the work of the stupa. On King Dutugamunu’s death bed he
            wanted to see this stupa and his brother covered the whole dome in
            white cloth and constructed the upper portion of the stupa in bamboo
            and painter it in imitation gold and carried the king to the stupa
            to show the “competed” stupa. After the kings death the Saddhatissa
            finished the remaining work. Around this stupa you will also see
            statues made out of granite of King Dutugamunu, Queen Vihara
            Mahadevi (Mother of king Dutugamunu) and King Bhathika Tissa of 2nd
            Century.

          <h4>Sri Maha Bodhi</h4>
          <p>
            WLord Gautama Buddha is considered as the Greatest Human Being
            appeared on earth. The esteemed one achieved the eternal bliss of
            Samma Sambodhi or the Enlightenment, ending the continuous circle of
            Samsara, the existence. This wonderful event took place 2600 years
            ago seated with his back against under an Esathu tree by the river
            Neranjana in the Bodhgaya, India. As the ascetic Siddhartha attained
            the Sambodhi Gnana under the shade of the Esathu tree, this highly
            venerated tree came to be known as the ‘Bodhi’. The southern branch
            of this sacred tree in Bodhgaya was ceremoniously brought to Sri
            Lanka by Arahant Sanghamitta MahaTheree in 236 BC, with the
            patronage of Emperor Dharmasoka. King Devanampiyatissa planted this
            Bodhi tree in his Royal Park ‘Maha Meghavana Udyanaya’ in
            Anuradhapura, under the guidance of Arahant Mihindu Maha Thero.
            Since then, this highly sacred Bodhi comparable to the living Buddha
            dwells there shining with glory. The Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi of
            Anuradhapura is the oldest living tree of the whole world with a
            written history.

          <h4>Jetavanaramaya Monastery</h4>
          <p>
            During the reign of king Gothabhaya (253-266 AC) a disagreement took
            place between the monks of Maha Vihara Monastery and the Abhayagiri
            Monastery regarding a certain doctrine. The king Gothabhaya took the
            side of the Maha Vihara and took severe measures against the monks
            of the Abhayagiri Monastery. During this time the monks of this
            monastery had to seek sanctuary in India. One of the disciples of
            the banished monks called Sangamitta thero decided to avenge the
            bikkus of Mahavihara. He came back to Sri Lanka and gained the
            favour of king Gothabhaya (253-266 AC) and was entrusted to teach
            his two sons prince Mahasena and Prince Jetthatissa. After their
            father’s death, the elder son prince Jetthatissa who was a supporter
            of the Mahavihara monks became the king and reigned for 10 years
            (266-276 AC).

          <h4>Isurumuniya</h4>
          <p>
            The Meghagiri Vihara is now commonly known as Isurumuniya Vihara or
            Isurumuniya. But the real Isurumuni Vihara is located few hundred
            metres away is now called Vessagiri Vihara. Isurumuniya is most
            famous for the stone carving of a couple located there. This carved
            stone was found in the royal pleasure garden and brought here. There
            are many interpretations for this carving. The most popular is that
            this carving shows the prince Saliya (the son of the great king
            Dutugamunu) and his mistress Asokamala. Asokamala was of a lover
            cast called “Chandala” and the prince Saliya gave up the right to be
            the king by marrying this girl of a lower cast. Another belief is
            that this couple represent the god Siva and goddess Parvathi of
            Hindu belief. The vihara also has another stone slab which depicts a
            court scene which is thought to be the court of king Dutugemunu.
            Both these stone slabs are thought to be originated in the 8th
            century. The vihara itself is built on a rock and the sacred tooth
            relic of Buddha has been originally kept here when it arrived to the
            island from India in the 312 AC.

          <h4>Mihintale – The cradle of Buddhism</h4>
          <p>
            Mihintale is a mountain peak near Anuradhapura in Sri Lanka. It is
            believed by Sri Lankans to be the site of a meeting between the
            Buddhist monk Mahinda and King Devanampiyatissa which inaugurated
            the presence of Buddhism in Sri Lanka. It is now a pilgrimage site,
            and the site of several religious monuments and abandoned
            structures.Approximately 12.5 km (7.8 mi) east of Anuradhapura,
            close to the Anuradhapura - Trincomalee Road is situated the
            "Missaka Pabbata" which is 1,000 feet (300 m) in height and is one
            of the peaks of a mountainous range. According to Dipavamsa and
            Mahavamsa, Thera Mahinda came to Sri Lanka from India on the full
            moon day of the month of Poson (June) and met King Devanampiyatissa
            and preached the Buddhist doctrine. The traditional spot where this
            meeting took place is revered by the Buddhists of Sri Lanka.
            Therefore, in the month of Poson, Buddhists make their pilgrimage to
            Anuradhapura and Mihintale. Mahinda was the son of Emperor Ashoka of
            India. King Ashoka embraced Buddhism after he was inspired by a monk
            named “Nigrodha.” The King was in great misery after witnessing the
            devastation caused by expansionist wars. Meeting this peaceful young
            monk was a turning point in his life, thereafter, he renounced war.
            He was determined to spread the message of peace. As a result, both
            his son and daughter were ordained as Buddhist monastics, and became
            enlightened Arahats. In his quest to spread the message of peace
            instead of war, Ashoka sent his son Mahinda, to the island of Lanka,
            which was also known as “Sinhalé”. This island was ruled by his
            friend King Devanampiyatissa. Thus, “Mahinda” was the Indian name,
            which in Sinhalé, became “Mihindu.”

          <h4>Samadhi Buddha Statue at Anuradhapura</h4>
          <p>
            Samadhi Statue is considered one of the best sculptures in the
            Anuradhapura era. It is thought to be done during the 3rd or the 4th
            century. It is made out of dolomite marble and stands 7 feet 3
            inches (2.21 metres) in height. This statue was found in the present
            location in 1886 fallen to the ground with damages to the nose. It
            was then erected and the nose was reconstructed. In 1914, it was
            found damaged by treasure hunters and re constructed again. The
            statue’s eyes are hollow indicating they were impressed with crystal
            or precious stones. It is unclear whether this and the 2nd statue
            were brought from another vihara or they were originally kept here.
            It is said that when you look at the face of the statue from three
            sides they show 3 different features. Looking at the profile of the
            face from left and right they show a slight sadness and a slightly
            smiling face on the other. Looking from the front, the face shows
            neutral features. Today this stature is covered by concrete
            structure which has somewhat destroyed the beauty of this statue.
            Even the reconstruction of the nose has not been a success which
            looks very artificial. Next to the Samadhi statue is an ruins of an
            image house which is called Bodhisattva Image House. According to
            Maha Vamsa, the great chronicle of Sri Lanka, it is said that the
            King Dhatusena (459-477) has built an image house for the Maithree
            Bodhisattva left to the Abhayagiriya Bodhi Tree Shrine and had
            decorated with royal garments. It is believed these remains are the
            image house built by king Dhatusena. An limestone Bodhisattva image
            has been found buried in the rubble which has been dated to the 5th
            century.

          <h4>Kuttam Pokuna (Twin Ponds)</h4>
          <p>
            Kuttam Pokuna or the twin ponds are another hydrologic engineering
            marvels of the ancient Sri Lanka. These two ponds belong to the
            Abayagiri aramic complex and probably been used by the monks for
            bathing. The origins of these ponds are not known but it is thought
            to have been built during the reign of King Aggabodhi I (575-608).
            The smaller pond (the northern) one has been constructed first and
            the larger one at a later stage. They are connected through a
            pipeline at the bottom. The northern pond is 91 feet (28 meters)
            long and the other 132 feet (40 meters) . Water to these ponds have
            been supplied through underground pipelines and the water is sent
            through several filtering chambers before it falls on the northern
            pond through a mouth of a dragon. The water from both ponds is
            drained from a small outlet in the smaller northern pond. Though the
            underground pipelines are no more, you can see 4 levels of filtering
            of the water before it enters the ponds.
