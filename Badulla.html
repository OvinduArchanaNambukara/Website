        <p>
          Badulla marks the southeast extremity of the Hill Country and is a
          transport gateway to the east coast. It is one of Sri Lanka’s oldest
          towns, occupied briefly by the Portuguese, who torched it upon
          leaving. For the British, it was an important social centre, but
          beyond the pretty gardens and clock tower, any vestiges of a past –
          including a racecourse and cricket club – are lost in Badulla’s
          typical Sri Lankan bustle. The railway through the Hill Country from
          Colombo terminates here. Select points of interest to plot on map by

          <p>
            Muthiyangana Raja Maha Viharaya is just one of the Badullaâ€™s many
            landmarks which will carry you to the time of Buddha. It is not
            quite difficult to be traveled in considering the religious places
            of tourism in Sri Lanka. It will not be quite difficult to find the
            temple as it is located in the middle of Badulla city. Being one of
            the most venerated religious places it is believed that the sacred
            jaw-bone is placed in the Stupa. Lord Buddha had arrived at Sri
            Lanka three times after his Enlightenment. Muthiyangana is one of
            those 3 destinations. At that time there were 3 major tribes in Sri
            Lanka called Deva, Naga and Yaksha. Lord Buddha was invited to visit
            Badulla by the King of Deva tribes Indaka. Thus King Indaka wanted
            something to worship in commemoration of Lord Buddha's 3rd arrival
            to Sri Lanka. Legends say that the Stupa is contained of Buddhaâ€™s
            Sacred hair and Mukthaka Dathu (few drops of sweat which had turned
            in to pearls ).
