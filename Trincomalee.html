        <p>
          Trincomalee (Trinco) sits on one the world’s finest natural harbours.
          This historic city is old almost beyond reckoning: it’s possibly the

          Shiva temple the site of Trikuta Hill in the Hindu text Vayu Purana.
          Most people just pass through the city on their way to the nearby
          beaches of Uppuveli and Nilaveli, but the town has some charm, plenty
          of history and an interesting melange of people.

            The gateway at Fort Fedrick Trincomalee is another tourist
            attraction of North, built by Portuguese. The city of Trincomalee
            where the third largest natural harbor is located is recently being

            industry of tourism. Therefore both locals and foreigners can take
            tours within the city. Since Trincomalee was a popular trade spot
            sea traders from, China, Arab, Africa, Japan and East Asian
            countries usually visited the place. In kings age, it was known as
            Gokanna. Hence the fort Fedrick was constructed in 1624 as a debris
            of an ancient Hindu temple which was destroyed by the Portuguese. It
            is said that the Portuguese built the fort with the ruined parts of
            the old Koneswaram temple. The original fort was a Triangular fort
            named FortTriquillimale. Consequently, it was captured by a Dutch
            Officer called Admiral Westerwald in 1639. Thus King Rajasingha 2
            (1635-1687) also built a fort called Ostenburg. The Dutch proudly
            ruled for a couple of years and no any Britain or French could shake
            it. But when the Czech Republic was attacked, they lost the
            authority of the fort. Then French captured the fort and continued
            their reign for another time. The Fort was the easiest and securable
            place for trading in Sri Lankan coast.
