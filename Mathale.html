        <h2>Matale</h2>
        <p>
          This midsize regional city at the heart of the island lies in a broad,
          fertile valley at an elevation of 300m. Matale is a featureless urban
          sprawl with a congested one-way system, so you're unlikely to want to
          linger long. However, the road north of town is lined with dozens of
          visitor-friendly spice plantations where vanilla, rubber, cinchona,
          jackfruit, cocoa and cardamom thrive. The area is also famous for
          kohila (a type of watercress) and small, mild chillies. The historical
          Buddhist site of Aluvihara just north of the town is also worth a
          visit.

          <h4>Aluvihare Rock Temple</h4>
          <p>
            The Aluvihare Rock Temple (also called Matale Alu Viharaya) is a
            sacred Buddhist temple located in Aluvihare, Matale District of Sri
            Lanka.Surrounded by hills, the Aluvihara cave temple is situated 30
            km north of Kandy on the Matale-Dambulla road. The history of
            Aluvihare Rock Temple is traced back to the 3rd Century B.C to the
            reign of King Devanampiyatissa. It is believed that the King built
            the dagoba, planted the Bo sapling and founded the temple after the
            introduction of Buddhism to the country during his reign. Aluvihare
            Rock Temple was the historic location where the Pāli Canon was first
            written down completely in text on ola (palm) leaves.Many monastery
            caves, some of which exhibit frescoes are situated near this temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            In between the 100 - 89 Century BC, during the reign of King
            Walagamba, Sri Lanka underwent a famine known as 'Baminithiyasaya'
            for 12 years. There was also a South Indian invasion at the same
            time and the Buddhist monks of that era realized that these problems
            would be a danger to the existence of Buddha Sasana in the country.
            Under these conditions, memorizing and repeating the Dhamma
            (doctrine) was difficult. Due to the famine Buddhist monks did not
            receive sufficient alms and faced many difficulties, and they had to
            eat yams, roots and leaves of trees for their survival. A group of
            about 60 of them went to Malaya Rata, which is said to be the hilly
            area of the country. They managed to live on the banks of Mahaweli
            river under harsh conditions and survived for 12 years till the
            famine came to an end.

          <h4>Dambulla Cave Temple</h4>
          <p>
            The world heritage site, Dambulla cave temple is a splendor to the
            Sri Lankan tourism. On the other hand, it is the largest persisting
            cave temple built on a 600 feet high rock in Sri Lanka. You will
            find nearly 80 documented caves in the area. It is evident that the
            caves were used as a prehistoric dwelling place before the arrival
            of Buddhism to Sri Lanka. A 2700-year-old skeleton was found within
            the burial site at Ibbakatuwa area, (close to the temple) during the
            excavations. The cave temples are cut into a granite rock boulder
            and drip ledge. The temple is called Dambulu gala or Rangiri Dambulu
            Viharaya by the locals. The cave temple was built by the King
            Vattagamini abhaya or King Walagamba during his escape from the
            throne The King had to abstain and survived from the south Indian
            invaders who onslaught Sri Lanka. However, King Walagmaba could
            regain and defeat the invaders and seized into the throne. Hence he
            was prompted to develop and reconstruct the cave temples. The
            Dambulla caves were also converted into a monastery complex.
            Afterward, KingVijayabahu 1 (1055-1110 AD) revamped the site and
            accommodated as a dwelling place for Bhikkhus. Although King Kirthi
            Sri Nishshankamalla (1887- 1196 AD) added several Buddha images to
            the cave temple. Many other kings like King Buvanekabahu (1372 -1408
            AD), King Vickramabahu 3 (1360- 1374 AD) King Rajasingha 1 (1581-
            1591 AD) renovated and maintained the Dambulla cave temple. Reaching
            the temple will be easy if you could take the Kandy- Anuradhapura A9
            road.

          <h4>Sigiriya</h4>
          <p>
            Sigiriya or Sinhagiri (Lion Rock Sinhala: සීගිරිය, Tamil: சிகிரியா,
            pronounced see-gi-ri-yə) is an ancient rock fortress located in the
            northern Matale District near the town of Dambulla in the Central
            Province, Sri Lanka. The name refers to a site of historical and
            archaeological significance that is dominated by a massive column of
            rock nearly 200 metres (660 ft) high. According to the ancient Sri
            Lankan chronicle the Culavamsa, this site was selected by King
            Kashyapa (477 – 495 AD) for his new capital. He built his palace on
            the top of this rock and decorated its sides with colourful
            frescoes. On a small plateau about halfway up the side of this rock
            he built a gateway in the form of an enormous lion. The name of this
            place is derived from this structure — Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Rock (an
            etymology similar to Sinhapura, the Sanskrit name of Singapore, the
            Lion City). The capital and the royal palace was abandoned after the
            king's death. It was used as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th
            century. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO listed World Heritage Site. It
            is one of the best preserved examples of ancient urban planning. Lal
            Srinivas and Mirando Obesekara described Sigiriya as a
            post-historical archeology turning point of Ravana. According to
            them, Sigiriya may be the Alakamandava (City of the Gods) that was
            built up before 50 centuries ago by King Kuvera who was the
            half-brother of Ravana (Ravan) as described in the Ramayanaya.

            Pidurangala rock fortress located close to the Sigiriya rock
            fortress is a rock with ancient forest monastery in Dambulla, Sri
            Lanka. The Pidurangla rock with the monastery has a strong
            connection between the Sigiriya. The Pidurangala monastery complex
            is the place where King Kashyapa (477-495 AC) worshiped and used to
            relocate the monks dwelled at Sigiriya. Yet King Kashyapa wanted to
            build his royal capital at Sigiriya the lower levels of the rock
            fortress were used by the Sangha to follow contemplation. Therefore
            the caves adjoined with the site area are formerly used by the monks
            for meditations. Pidurangala monastery was distinguished as a
            well-civilized site too. The Brahmin inscriptions found at the
            complex say that the viharaya was established as a â€˜Panchavasaâ€™
            style Hermitage (comprised of 5 major ritual buildings). Moreover,
            you will find the inscriptions done made by King kashyapa. You can
            visit old dagoba, chapter house (dwelling place of bhikkus),
            Bodhigara (bo tree chamber), Preaching wall, image house and ruins
            of the archeological site. Hence the pirivena of the temple was
            accommodated by 500 bhikkus. The old monastery was called as
            Uppalavanna kashyapa Giri viharaya. A flight of steps located on the
            right-hand side from the cave temple will take you up t the summit
            and here you will see a 48 feet recumbent Buddha statue in an
            elongated ancient cave.

          <h4>Nalanda Gedige, Matale</h4>
          <p>
            Nalanda Gedige ( sinhala:නාලන්දා ගෙඩිගේ ) ( Tamil: நாலந்த கெடிகே;
            Nālanda Gedige ) is an ancient complete stone temple near Matale,
            Sri Lanka and its original site was considered as the center of Sri
            Lanka. The building was constructed in between 8th and 10th
            centuries with dravidian architecture in( Pallava style )and is
            believed to have been used by Buddhists. Also some scholars describe
            this building is a dravidian architecture dedicated to a Mahayanaa
            cult with pronounced Trantric learning and known for an ancient
            monument of possible Vajrayana (Tantric) Buddhist affinities.
            Nalanda Gedige is designed on the lines of a Hindu temple with a
            mandapa, an entrance hall (originally roofed), a short passage to a
            bare cello, and an ambulatory round the holy center. A limited
            number of the original Hindu deity statuettes exist within the
            temple, however, a statue of the God Kubera appears on the south
            side of the tympanum over the sanctuary, a feature that can only be
            seen in Sri Lanka. The richly decorated facade sections, laboriously
            reassembled in 1975, are predominantly in the South Indian style.
            Although they cannot be precisely dated, they are believed to have
            originated sometime between the 8 to 11th centuries.

          <h4>Knuckles Mountain Range</h4>
          <p>
            The Knuckles forest conservation which expands over Matale and Kandy
            district is under control of the Department of forest conservation.
            It is believed that the name â€˜knucklesâ€™ was assigned by the
            British surveyors. The mountain range gets this name as it appears
            like a clenched fist at a distance. Absolutely the wonderful scenery
            viewed from the distance is breathtakingly mysterious. Hence it is a
            refreshing change from the hot climatic experience in Colombo. This
            is the best place to relax on the way and definitely, it will blow
            you away. The mist enveloped the peaks of the mountains seems like a
            heaven in the forest. The forest houses to a cluster of exclusive
            flora and fauna which has a great geographical value. Knuckleâ€™s
            mountain range is comprised with steep slopes, thick cloud capped
            hill peaks, cool streams, and high cascades. (December and January
            are the rainy seasons- streams get filled to the Brinks) This eco
            tourism paradise covers an area about 155 sq km. Yet the mountain
            range is an ideal place for hiking, mountain biking, and adventure
            trips. The Knuckles Mountains is well known as â€˜Dumbara kandu
            wetiyaâ€™ among local people. Due to the high elevation, you will
            have to get ready to experience a cold but cushy. But you may have
            to adopt various climatic conditions of Sri lanka within the
            mountain area. Further, it is a good place for environmental
            enthusiasts to visit traditional small mountain houses. Though the
            area was called â€˜Giri Divainaâ€™ and as â€˜Malaya rataâ€™ recently
            used and accommodated by the ancient â€˜Yakshaâ€™ tribes.

          <h4>Bambarakiri Ella</h4>
          <p>
            This magnificent waterfall is situated close to Rattota town in
            Matale District. Take Matale – Ilukumbura road to the Bamarakiri
            Falls bend, which is 1km past Rattota town, where the fall is to be
            found. The Bambarakiri Falls is 18km from Matale town.The fall is
            set amidst the mesmerizing greenery of the Knuckles mountain range.
            Bambarakiri Ella is a fall of 10m. The fall can be viewed in three
            parts. Different varieties of butterflies and birds come to the area
            of the falls mostly in clear mornings making the view even more
            charming. A very old-fashioned suspension bridge extends over the
            falls adding an enchanting touch to the already beautiful
            scene.Gallons of water come crashing down to earth at a high speed.
            The rock pool at the base of the waterfall is safe for a dip during
            the dry summer, but can be very dangerous during heavy rainy season.
            For those who yearn for more adventure, there is a steep slippery
            climb of 5km, to reach the top of the waterfall. But one should bear
            in mind that a slight mistake will result in grave injury. Although
            the climb is not easy and should be done with care, the views of the
            landscape from the top are breathtaking. In addition, there is a
            wonderful bonus for those that make the effort of the climb – a cool
            and crystal clear natural rock pool perfect for bathing. This
            tranquil and peaceful place is indeed a hidden gem in Matale.
            Visitors who come to the areas in Matale for holidays are strongly
            recommended to visit this beautiful place.
