          <h4>Devinuwara Temple</h4>
          <p>
            Dondra (also known as Devinuwara) is also known as the City of God.
            This religiously relevant and established city is located about four
            miles away from the main city of Matara, Sri Lanka. It is however
            situated on a small peninsula that is interspersed amongst a lot of
            architectural artifacts that comprise of the huts, plantations for
            coconut, various huts, and pillars. These pillars are made of stone
            and stand in an upright position to increase the grandeur of Dondra.
            There is, however, a great and magnificent temple that is known as
            the Temple of Vishnu. It is also the only Vishnu temple that is in
            the area of Dondra. Due to this, it is very famous and popular
            amongst the community of Vishnu preachers. This temple also leads to
            a wide and broad road that contains many styles and abundance of the
            coconut trees. This road then leads to a plain road that leads to
            the group of these stone pillars that are standing straight and also
            are near to the sea shore. However there is a single stone pillar in
            the middle of it which attracts attention of the tourists. It is
            situated precisely at the low rocky point which serves as a way of
            breaking the sea waves that are amidst the stones shaped in hewn
            form.

          <h4>Matara Fort</h4>
          <p>
            The Matara Fort was built in the year 1560 by the Portuguese.
            However historically, it is stated that the fort was built by Dutch
            as they captured the city of Galle. Matara fort has become of the
            best destinations for spending the holidays in Sri Lanka. It is very
            famous and has a number of well-established hotels, guest houses,
            entertainment facilities, etc. that people can enjoy. The Matara
            city is really enjoyed a lot by the romantic couples and honeymoon
            travelers as it presents a nice touch to the romantic side of
            humans. The beaches, beautiful resorts and entertainments like
            fishing, surfing, whale watching, etc. all contribute to the beauty
            of this place. There is also a spectacular view of the river Nilwala
            that is liked and appreciated by these people who tour the area.
            This locality of Matara is on the land tongue that is precisely
            placed between the green lagoon and the ocean. The fort is protected
            by its part or section of landside with 13 meters of thicker walls
            that are also about 5 meters tall in height. The Matara Fort is not
            protected from all other 3 locations other than the presence of
            water on all of these 3 sides. This water aspect on 3 sides also
            provides a natural barrier to its fort. The thickness of these sites
            also is very much impressive as the person can stand on top of it
            and view the scenes around.

          <h4>Mirissa Water Sports & Whale Watching</h4>
          <p>
            The town of Mirissa is well known amongst the tourist community as
            it has been a famous destination for many national and international
            tourists for years now. People who love to travel for holidays and
            want to explore new tourist destinations would seriously fall in
            love with the place. It is situated between the two renowned and
            beautiful cities of Galle and the Matara. It is in the shape of a
            crescent and looks aesthetically so attractive between the two
            cities. Clear waters, healthy environment, normal sea waves, and the
            fine sand all add to its attractiveness for the tourists from all
            over the globe. Mirissa is also well known amongst the tourists for
            its well-structured sports facilities. The water sports like
            surfing, swimming, etc. are available in the zone and they are
            perfectly safe for children of all ages as the water is not deep.
            The shallow water is really good for walking but it is not
            recommended to go far into the sea as there are some slightly
            dangerous areas where depth increases. In order to get to this area,
            a tourist can opt for the taxi or public transport whichever he
            deems affordable and suitable. There are many luxurious hotels and
            tourist destinations in Mirissa and that is why a lot of honeymoon
            packages are structured by them to attract and help the new couples
            getting married.
