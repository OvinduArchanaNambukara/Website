        <h2>Ratnapura</h2>
        <p>
          A bustling, congested city, Ratnapura hosts few travellers but is a
          famous trading centre for the area’s wealth of gemstones. As you
          explore the town, you're sure to encounter some hustle from pushy
          salespeople eager to flog you a gemstone (or a piece of polished
          glass). Another reason to visit Ratnapura is that it’s the take-off
          point for one of the oldest routes up Adam’s Peak.
