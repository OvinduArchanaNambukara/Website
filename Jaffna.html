        <h2>Jaffna</h2>
        <p>
          A bastion of Hindu tradition, art and creative culture, Jaffna
          welcomes visitors warmly. Itâ€™s intriguing, unimposing, slightly off
          the beaten path and a thoroughly rewarding place to discover Sri
          Lankan Tamil culture. Inescapably, decades of war, emigration,
          embargoes and loss of life and property deeply affected this historic
          town, but the city is surprisingly green and leafy, with attractive
          palm-shaded colonial-era suburbs and beautiful temples and churches.
          Physically, new projects and upgraded transport connections show that
          Jaffna's days of isolation are long past.

          <h4>Nagadeepa Purana Vihara</h4>
          <p>
            Nagadipa Purana viharaya basking on the island Nainativu in Jaffna
            is one of the ideal places to be toured. The famous stupa was being
            worshipped since from the 1st century. Certainly the trip to
            Nagadipa Temple is like an adventure. The route located from Jaffna
            runs askew along causeway to the Kayts and another cause way to the
            Punkudativu. So you have to begin from Kurikadduwan pier at
            Pinudativu Island by a ferry. This Punkudative Island is linked by a
            causeway across the Palk bay to kayts. The total distance will be
            about 30 from Jaffna to Nagadipa. In accordance to the great
            chronicle 'Mahawansa', it is one of the most venerable places of Sri
            Lanka. Nagadipa Purana viharaya basking on the island Nainativu in

          <p>
            In order to visit the best beach in Jaffna peninsula you have to
            reach about 20 km off from Jaffna. It is in karainagar. Travelers
            can free roam and walk a long way to the deep blue water. The beach
            gets this name as the Casuarina trees along the beach. Hence the
            beach is high light for the Sri lankan tourism. Obviously the beach
            is clean and well maintained by the authorities. Perhaps an entering
            fee will be charged in order to maintain the beach. Recently Jaffna
            was captured by the terrorists during the lasted 30 year war.
            Therefore tourists procrastinate Jaffna in their tours to Sri lanka.
            Henceforward Jaffna is open to all. In order to visit the best beach
