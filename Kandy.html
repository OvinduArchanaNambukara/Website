        <h2>Kandy</h2>
        <p>
          Some days Kandy’s skies seem perpetually bruised, with stubborn mist
          clinging to the hills surrounding the city’s beautiful centrepiece
          lake. Delicate hill-country breezes impel the mist to gently part,
          revealing colourful houses amid Kandy’s improbable forested halo. In
          the centre of town, three-wheelers careen around slippery corners,
          raising a soft spray that threatens the silk saris worn by local
          women. Here’s a city that looks good even when it’s raining.

          <h4>Temple of the Tooth Relic (Dalada Maligawa)</h4>
          <p>
            Kandy was the capital of the Singhalese Kings from 1592 to 1815.
            Fortified by a terrain of mountains and the difficult approach Kandy
            managed to operate in independence from Dutch, Portuguese and the
            English till 1815. The city is a world heritage site declared by
            UNESCO, in part due to this temple. The Sri Dalada Maligawa or The
            Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is a temple in the city of Kandy in
            Sri Lanka. It was built within the royal palace complex which houses
            the one of the two surviving relic of the tooth of Buddha, an object
            of veneration for Buddhists. The other tooth relic is believed to be
            enshrined in a stupa called Somawathi Chethiya. The Sri Dalada
            Maligawa in Kandy, the temple which houses the Sacred Tooth Relic of
            The Buddha, is possibly the most sacred Buddhist shrine in the
            world. It is venerated not only by Buddhists in Sri Lanka but by
            Buddhists all over the world. King Wimaladharmasuriya I (1592 –
            1603), the first to select Kandy as the ruling capital originally
            built a two storied Temple for the Relic and brought the tooth relic
            from Delgamuwa near Kuruwita in Sabaragamuwa which has been hidden
            for protection. Remains of this temple no longer exist.
            Wimaladharmasuriya II (1686 – 1706) built a three storied temple and
            his son king Viraparakrama Narendrasinha (1706 – 1738), the last
            Sinhalese king to rule the country, built a new two storied temple
            temple seeing that the old temple built by his father has decayed.
            The last king of Sri lanka, Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe (1797 – 1814)
            built the Pattirippuwa (the Octagon). Originally, the Pattirippuwa
            (octagon) was part of the royal palace. It was used by the king to
            address his follow countrymen. Today the Pattirippuwa has become a
            part of the temple and houses ancient textures written in ola
            leaves.

          <h4>Degaldoruwa Raja Maha Vihara</h4>
          <p>
            The Kandyan king, Kirti Sri Rajasinghe (1747-1780) was a great
            patron of the arts. It was during his time that some of the best
            paintings in upcountry temples were created. Among them, the
            Degaldoruwa Raja Maha Vihara paintings stand out. Degaldoruwa is
            just a few miles away from Kandy close to Kundasale and is well
            worth a visit to get an idea of the Kandyan style of paintings.
            Incidentally, the temples which received the patronage of the king
            came to be known as ‘Raja Maha Viharas’ and to this day they are
            identified as such. So when you next see a name board of a temple
            with the wording ‘Raja Maha Vihara’, that means the king had given
            lands and other valuables to that temple. While the Degaldoruwa
            paintings were started by King Kirti Sri Rajasinghe, the king had
            died before they were completed. It was during the reign of his
            younger brother, King Rajadhi Rajasinghe, who succeeded him, that
            they were completed. After the work was done, the king had handed it
            over to Moratota Dhammarakhkhita Nayaka Thera, who was his teacher.
            Popularly known as Moratota Hamuduruwo, he was a very learned
            monk.<br />

          <h4>Ceylon Tea Museum in Hantana</h4>
          <p>
            Kandy is a mandatory stop on virtually every tourist itinerary. Its
            scenic beauty, the salubrious climate, the Temple of the Tooth
            Relic, The Kandy Perahera and Peradeniya Botanical Gardens have all
            contributed to it being a famous tourist destination. A new addition
            to these attractions is the Ceylon Tea Museum, which is one of a
            kind as this is the first Tea Museum in the world. A few years ago,
            some ex-planters were concerned about the tea industry and were keen
            to impart their knowledge about the industry to the general public
            and decided to set up a tea museum. Thus in 1975, Sri Lanka State
            Plantations Corporation Chairman Clifford Ratwatte visited the Great
            Western Tea Factory in Talawakelle and having seen old dismantled
            machinery suggested to the Superintendent of that factory,
            Dharmasiri Madugalle, that a Museum should be established
            immediately to preserve the disused machinery as they were being
            replaced with modern machinery. “Thereafter, I made a note of all
            the old machinery on my visits to the estates, especially those in
            Kandy and Matale areas as the oldest tea factories were located
            there. The project commenced at the end of 1977 after leasing out
            the abandoned Hantana Tea Factory from the Janatha Estates
            Development Board (JEDB).” “It was not an easy task as we had to
            repair the discarded machinery and make it fit for display. The
            disused machinery had to be identified and transported to the
            Museum. It took us (A retired engine driver V. Narayanpillai
            assisted me in this arduous task) about three years,” said Mr.
            Dharmasiri Madugalle, Manager Ceylon Tea Museum.

          <h4>Magul Maduwa (Audience Hall) of the Kandyan Palace</h4>
          <p>
            The “Magul Maduwa” of the Palace is where the king met his ministers
            and and carried out his daily administrative tasks. This was also
            known as the “Maha Naduwa” (high court) by the local residence as
            this building was used by the king as the court. This building is
            also called the Assembly Hall or the Audience Hall. The construction
            of this finely carved wooden structure has been started by the king
            Rajadhi Rajasinhe (1779 – 1797) in 1783. but was unable to complete
            it within his reign. A number of key events in our history has taken
            place in this “Magul Maduwa”. The major one being the handing over
            the last Sri Lankan kingdom to the British throne in 1815 ending
            over 2500 years of sovereignty. It was at this place that the
            British handed over the death sentence to the sri lankan patriots,
            Madugalle Disave and the Keppatipola Disave.In the early days of the
            British occupation, the British Missionaries used this Audience Hall
            as their Church building in their conversion process. This Audience
            Hall which played a key role in the Kingdom was considered a place
            where the ‘most horrid cruelties were exercised’ by these
            missionaries. The Lord Bishop of Calcutta, Rev Reginald Herber
            describe a sermon held in this hall in his book ‘Narrative of a
            Journey Through the Upper provinces of India‘ published in 1829;

            Lake with the Walakulu wall around it Queens Bathing house on the
            edge of the Kandy lake Island at the centre of the lake This
            artificial lake (Kandy Lake /the Nuwara Wewa) was built by the last
            king of Kandy (and of Sri Lanka), Sri Wikrama Rajasinhe to beatify
            the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Dalada Maligawa) by excavating paddy
            fields in 1807. He called this artificial lake the :Kiri Muhuda” or
            the Milky Ocean. He also added the “Valakulu Bamma” (the clouds
            wall) around the lake but before he could complete, British forces
            invaded the city of Kandy and prisoned the last Kandyan King in
            1815. The Walakulu Wall still remains in the same unfinished state
            with a length of 2060 feet. The triangular holes in the wall has
            been used to light oil lamps in the night. This same design has been
            used for the outer wall of Sri Dalada Maligawa. He also built a dam
            across the lake to travel to the other side of the lake but then he
            destroyed it from both ends leaving only a portion in the centre
            creating an island. On the Dalada Maligawa side of the lake is the
            Queens Bathing House. Which is partially in the lake itself. The
            perimeter of the lake is about 3.4 km and the walakulu wall runs to
            about 2060 feet around the lake.

          <h4>British Garrison Cemetery of Kandy</h4>
          <p>
            I was told of the old Garrison Cemetery of Kandy established in
            1817, by a friend, himself a Canadian national, who spent more years
            in Sri Lanka than in his home country. It was not a difficult place
            to find, conveniently situated along a short drive uphill, adjoining
            the National Museum of Kandy. Wanting to check it out one day, I
            made an early appearance at 8 am at the huge iron gates that were
            yet closed. The caretaker Mr. Charles Carmichael opened the gate for
            us at 8.30. It was an oblong piece of land shadowed by hills and
            overlooking the Kandy Lake. On its boundaries, tall wild grass grew.
            Under the trees we walked on its flower splattered well trimmed
            grass, marking the resting places; telling the names and dates of
            those Europeans who died in Kandy and its vicinity. However,
            according to J.P. Lewis writing before 1913, there was a far larger
            number of graves which tell no tale, except that the remains of some
            stranger rest beneath. Lewis called it the ‘European graveyard of
            Kandy’, in his book on the ‘List of Inscriptions on Tombstones and
            Monuments in Ceylon’ published in 1913. (The book was printed by
            H.C. Cottle, Government Printer Ceylon to be purchased at the
            Government Record Office, Colombo at the price of Rs. 5). <br />

          <h4>Ehelepola Walawwa in Kandy</h4>
          <p>
            Ehelapola Nilame (1773 – 1829) was a courtier of the Kingdom of
            Kandy. He was the 1st Adigar (Maha Adikaram) from 1811 to 1814 under
            the reign King Sri Wikrama Rajasinha. After Ehelapola Kumari Hami
            (wife of Ehelapola Disawe) and his two children were brutally
            murdered by the king, he aided the British in launching an invasion
            of the Kandy Kingdom and was instrumental in the Kandyan Convention
            that followed which led to the annexing of Kandy Kingdom to the
            British Empire. Once the British took over Kandy, they didn’t waste
            much time in rounding up all the chieftains, nobles and Buddhist
            prelates of the kingdom. Ehelapola Walawwa was used as the prison
            most of the Nobels. Madugalle Nilame, Ellepola Nilame, Keppatipola
            Nilame and Kivulegedara Mohottirala were some of the residents of
            this prison before they were murdered by the British.Thereafter
            Ehelapola Walawwa continued to be part of the Kandy prison complex
            until independence in 1948. But unfortunately even after
            independence, the Walawwa continued to be part of the Bogambara
            Prison despite many attempts to open it up to the public an heritage
            building. But in 2013, after almost 200 years, The Prison department
            released the Walawwa to the President for development and for public
            display but unfortunately this Walawwa still stands as it was
            without public access.
