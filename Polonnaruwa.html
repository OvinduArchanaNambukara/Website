        <h2>Polonnaruwa</h2>
        <p>
          Kings ruled the central plains of Sri Lanka from Polonnaruwa 800 years
          ago, when it was a thriving commercial and religious centre. The
          glories of that age can be found in the archaeological treasures that
          still give a pretty good idea of how the city looked in its heyday.
          You'll find the archaeological park a delight to explore, with
          hundreds of ancient structures – tombs and temples, statues and stupas
          – in a compact core. The Quadrangle alone is worth the trip.

          <h4>Parakrama Samudraya</h4>
          <p>
            This vast water reservoir was built by King Parakramabahu the great
            (1153-1186) and today what you see as the Parakrama Samudraya is
            only a portion of his original creation. Parakrama Samudraya
            originally consisted of five large reservoirs separated by smaller
            dams to reduce the pressure on the main dam. Many smaller tanks has
            been built around the main tank to feed these primary tanks and to
            take in excess water.During reconstruction of the Parakrama
            Samudraya in the latter half of 19th centuary, the water which was
            supposed to flow to the Thopa Vawa has started flowing to the Bhu
            Vewa. To control this the engineers constructed a temporary dam to
            block the water flowing to the Bhu Vewa. This temporary dam became a
            permanent road and this road isolated Kalahagala Vewa and Bhu Vewa
            from the Parakrama Samudraya.The new reconstruction process has
            ignored most of the ancient technology which this tank was built in
            reducing the capacity of the tank further. As at today, the dam of
            Parakrama Samudraya is 8 ½ miles (14 kilometres) in length and 40
            feet (12.2 metres) in height. The body of water covers 5350 acres
            with an average depth of 25 feet. Over 18000 acres of paddy land is
            supported by this reservoir.

          <h4>Gal Viharaya</h4>
          <p>
            This magnificent group of statues was built by king Parakramabahu
            (1153-1186) which was part of the Uthararama Complex. The first
            statute you will come across is a seated Buddha in meditation. He is
            seated on a lotus. The rock behind the statue is decorated with
            carvings of “vimana”. Four smaller Buddha statues can be seen on
            these decorations. Next is a smaller statue of Buddha (about 15 feet
            high) carved in to the rock. On the sides of the statue are two
            deities. It is believed this carving represent the Buddhas visit to
            heaven called “Thusitha” to preach to his mother. It is said that
            this statue was painted with pure gold and treasure hunters have
            burnt logs on the statue and melted the gold. Third is a standing
            statue of Buddha. This has been disputed by some and think this is
            the statue of Ananda thero at the site of lord Buddha’s passing
            away. This 23 feet tall statue is thought to be done by a later king
            as the chronicles talk about only two statues in the seating
            position and one statue on the lying position which was done by King
            Parakramabahu (1153-1186). Next and the last is a massive statue of
            Buddha passing way. This is 80 feet long. The ear lid falling along
            the body, One foot slightly behind the other (The toes are not
            positioned equally on the feet) are signs that this is not Lord
            Buddha resting but at his death.

          <h4>Thivanka Pilimage</h4>
          <p>
            Thivanka Pilimage had been built by King Parakramabahu (1153-1186)
            as part of the Jethavanarama Complex. Since the large image of
            Buddha has been curved in 3 places, this has been given the name
            “Thivanka” which literally means three curves. As most other
            structures of this era, this is too built with bricks including the
            statue. The Buddha statue at the Thivanka Pilimage is about 8 meters
            in height but today the part of the statue above the head has been
            destroyed. The statue as at today is 6.6 metres tall. The building
            is 133 feet long and 67.6” feet wide. The walls are 7-12 feet thick
            making the internal size of the building much smaller. The inside
            walls of the buildings has been decorated with frescoes showing the
            Jataka Stories (prior births of Buddha before enlightenment)
            although most of the masonry has been destroyed, the colorful
            drawings can be still seen on the areas where masonry is intact. The
            entrance to the building consists of two guard stones and two
            “Korawak Gala” The outer restoration of the this image house has
            been carried out at a snail pace for the last 15 years and has been
            covered with shuttering though out the this period.

          <h4>Nelum Pokuna (Lotus Pond)</h4>
          <p>
            The Pokuna or the baths found at Polonnaruwa are comparatively of
            modest dimensions. The architecturally perfect Kumara pokuna found
            close to King Parakramabahu’s palace, the pokuna found near the rest
            house and believed to be that of King Nissanka malla, the austere
            baths of the Alahana pirivena are some examples. Yet a jewel of the
            pokuna architecture lies hidden along the lonely road to the
            northern city, well away from the bus loads of pilgrims and tourists
            that crowd Polonnaruwa’s more famous quadrangle packed with ruins
            from different dynasties differing in architecture and style. The
            Nelum pokuna or the Lotus bath is a small stone bath of completely
            unique design, built in tiers of eight petalled lotuses in
            descending form. The fine cut granite is in excellent formation and
            an absolute delight to the modern day tourist. The atmosphere of
            garden-like surroundings with its ancient flowering trees enhance
            its magnificence. The chronicle speaks of a lotus bath among many
            ponds constructed by Parakramabahu the Great. It is believed to be
            the bath provided by the King for the monks belonging to the
            Jetavana Vihara. The Archaeological Commissioner describing this
            granite marvel in his annual Report for 1990 says that the artistic
            conception of the stone bath is worthy of all praise. He requests
            the reader to imagine a gigantic lotus flower of granite in full
            bloom 24 ft. 9 in. diameter, with five concentric laminae of eight
            petals, gradually diminishing to a stamen 5 ft. 4 in. across.

          <h4>Moonstone</h4>
          <p>
            In later stages after the Polonnaruwa Era, the moonstone started to
            appear in various shapes such as triangular shapes ( Sri Dalada
            Maligawa – Kandy) and full circular shapes ( Horana Raja Maha
            Viharaya). The carvings of the moonstones also became varied loosing
            the standard symbols and patterns. If the patterns in the moonstone
            represented any symbolic religious meaning, this was totally
            forgotten after the Polonnaruwa Era. But none of these moonstones
            didn’t show the level of workmanship that of the Anuradhapura /
            Pollonaruwa Era craftsmen. Historians believe that this was due to
            the craftsman of later kingdoms lacked the artistic skills of the
            older generations and they attempted to create variety and complex
            patterns in order to make their moonstones attractive to the eye.

          <h4>Parakramabahu Statue at Pothgul Vehera</h4>
          <p>
            This beautifully carved statue stands 11½ feet (3.5 meters) in
            height and carved in to a semi-circular rock. Popular belief is that
            this is the statue of king Parakramabahu (1153-1186) thus generally
            known as the Parakramabahu Statue. . Another belief is that this is
            a statue of an Indian high priest (probably “Kapila” of “Pulasthi”).
            The long beard and the mustache, the hair, the clothing, and the
            body with a slightly large stomach are not what you would expect
            from a statue of a great king. Irrespective of who this represent,
            this is a quite beautiful and unique statue showing the highest
            level of craftsmanship of the rock carving engineers of that time.
            This statue can be reached by traveling about 1 ½ kilometres along
            the Parakrama Samudraya dam. There is a small unidentified and
            destroyed Chethya closer to this statue. It is believed by some that
            this is the burial ground of king Parakramabahu and this stupa holds
            the remains of the king.

          <h4>Atadage at Polonnaruwa</h4>
          <p>
            Atadage Dalada Maligaya is the house of the tooth relic of Buddha
            built by King Vijayabahu I (1070-1110). This building is built on 54
            stone pillars. The tooth relic has been kept on the second floor
            probably made out of wood. The access to the second floor is through
            a granite stair case. Few steps still remains of this staircase
            which led to the upper chamber of the building. There has been three
            Buddha statues at the bottom and only the center one remain today.
            Also this is thought to be the only surviving building of the king
            Vijayabahu I. “Ata” in Atadage means eight. In this case this
            building would have been called by this name probably because of it
            housed eight relics including the main tooth relic or because it was
            completed in eight days. It is possible that this was built in eight
            days as there are indications that this building has used parts of
            other buildings in Anuradhapura era. The moonstone is a good
            example. This has been brought from Anuradhapura to be placed here.
            The “Velikkara” inscription stone on the left to this building is of
            significance. This is written in tamil language and explains that
            the protection of the tooth relic was done by a hired tamil army and
            not by the Sinhalese. Today what remains here is the foundation and
            the stone pillars.
